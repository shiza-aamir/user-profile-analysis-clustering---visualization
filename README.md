# user-profile-analysis-clustering---visualization

## Project Overview
This project, completed during my internship at AICP, focuses on analyzing user profiles to enhance targeted advertising strategies. By leveraging clustering algorithms, the project segments users into distinct groups and visualizes their unique characteristics, providing valuable insights for marketing efforts.

## Introduction
The project aims to segment user profiles to identify distinct audience groups for more effective advertising. Using clustering techniques, we uncover hidden patterns and insights within the data.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises user profiles with features such as demographic information, device usage, and engagement metrics. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare it for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Reviewed descriptive statistics.
- Normalized numerical features for consistent analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to visualize key demographic distributions and examine device usage and engagement metrics, providing an initial understanding of the data.

## Clustering
The KMeans clustering algorithm was applied to segment users into five distinct clusters:
1. **Weekend Warriors**
2. **Engaged Professionals**
3. **Low-Key Users**
4. **Active Explorers**
5. **Budget Browsers**

## Cluster Analysis
For each cluster, the mean values of numerical features and the mode of categorical features were calculated to define their unique characteristics.

## Visualization
Radar charts were developed using matplotlib to visually represent the unique characteristics of each cluster.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of clustering in understanding user behavior and tailoring marketing strategies to different audience segments.
